Description: This R software package guides an exploration of integrated genomic data that involves genetic (genotype) information, high-dimensional intermediate traits (e.g., gene expression, protein abundance) and/or higher-order traits (phenotypes) in the genome. The package includes functions to: (1) construct global linkage map between genetic marker and gene expression; (2) analyze multiple-locus linkage (epistasis) for gene expression; (3) quantify the proportion of genome-wide variation explained by each locus and identify eQTL linkage hotspots; (4) estimate pair-wise causal gene regulatory probability and construct gene regulatory networks; and (5) identify causal genes for a quantitative trait of interest.
