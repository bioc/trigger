Description: This R package provides tools for the statistical analysis of integrative genomic data that involve some combination of: genotypes, high-dimensional intermediate traits (e.g., gene expression, protein abundance), and higher-order traits (phenotypes). The package includes functions to: (1) construct global linkage maps between genetic markers and gene expression; (2) analyze multiple-locus linkage (epistasis) for gene expression; (3) quantify the proportion of genome-wide variation explained by each locus and identify eQTL hotspots; (4) estimate pair-wise causal gene regulatory probabilities and construct gene regulatory networks; and (5) identify causal genes for a quantitative trait of interest.
